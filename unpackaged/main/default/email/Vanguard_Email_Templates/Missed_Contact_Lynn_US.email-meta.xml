    <subject>Your Quote Request | BOXX Modular</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.Name},

Your modular building quote request for {!Lead.Company}, {!Lead.Address} is very important to our team at BOXX Modular. Unfortunately, I have not yet had the pleasure of connecting with you over the phone; and that likely is because you are very busy.

- Is there a particular time of day that would work best for me to contact you?
- Is {!Lead.Phone} the best phone number for me to reach you?

If you could please let me know as I would be happy to schedule a time that is convenient for you, to connect.

We rent furniture, steps, and decks so you can get up-and-running quickly when you move into your building.  You may want to browse some of the options available. We are happy to provide custom quantities and options when needed. https://www.boxxmodular.com/add-ons/

Thank you for your interest in BOXX Modular, I look forward to speaking with you soon!

We are here to help!
