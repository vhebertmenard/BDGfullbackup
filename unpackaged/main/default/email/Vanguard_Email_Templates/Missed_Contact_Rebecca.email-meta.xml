    <subject>Your Quote Request | BOXX Modular</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.Name},

Your modular building quote request for {!Lead.Company}, {!Lead.Address} is very important to us.

Unfortunately, I have not yet had the pleasure of connecting with you over the phone; and that likely is because you are very busy.

- Is there a particular time of day that would work best for me to contact you?
- Is {!Lead.Phone} the best phone number for me to reach you?

If you could please let me know as it would be my pleasure to schedule a time that is suitable for us to connect.

Thank you for your interest in BOXX Modular, I look forward to speaking with you soon!

Have a great day!
