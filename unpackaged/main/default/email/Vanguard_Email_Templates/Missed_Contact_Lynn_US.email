<p>Hello {!Lead.Name},</p>
<p>Your modular building quote request for {!Lead.Company}, {!Lead.Address} is very important to our team at BOXX Modular. Unfortunately, I have not yet had the pleasure of connecting with you over the phone; and that likely is because you are very busy.</p>

- Is there a particular time of day that would work best for me to contact you?<br/>
- Is {!Lead.Phone} the best phone number for me to reach you?<br/>

<p>If you could please let me know as I would be happy to schedule a time that is convenient for you, to connect.</p>

We rent furniture, steps, and decks so you can get up-and-running quickly when you move into your building.  You may want to browse some of the <a href="https://www.boxxmodular.com/add-ons/">options available</a>. We are happy to provide custom quantities and options when needed.
