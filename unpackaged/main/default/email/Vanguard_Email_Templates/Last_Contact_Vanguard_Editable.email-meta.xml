    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.Name},

You submitted a request to receive a modular building quote, but unfortunately we haven&apos;t been able to connect with you about space for {!Lead.Company} in {!Lead.State}, {!Lead.PostalCode}.

We want to help you get the space you need, so our local representative is going to reach out to you once more. {!Lead.OwnerFullName} ({!Lead.OwnerEmail} | {!Lead.OwnerPhone}) is looking forward to providing you with the modular information you requested.

We understand you are busy so if there is a particular date and time that works best for a call, simply reply to this email and let us know.

Sincerely,
