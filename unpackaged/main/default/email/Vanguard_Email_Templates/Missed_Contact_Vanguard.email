<p>Hello {!Lead.Name},</p>
<p>Your modular building quote request for {!Lead.Company}, {!Lead.Address} is very important to us.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have not yet had the pleasure of connecting with you over the phone; and that likely is because you are very busy.</p>

- Is there a particular time of day that would work best for me to contact you?<br/>
- Is {!Lead.Phone} the best phone number for me to reach you?<br/>

<p>If you could please let me know as it would be my pleasure to schedule a time that is suitable for us to connect.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in BOXX Modular, I look forward to speaking with you soon!</p>

<p>Have a great day!</p>
